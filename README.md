# Library-Manangement-System
A Library Management System (LMS) project that uses a HashMap is designed to facilitate the efficient management of library resources such as books, their issuance, return, and the display of these resources. Here's a brief description of how such a system might work:

1. **Data Storage**: The system utilizes a HashMap data structure to store and manage information about books in the library. Each book is associated with a unique identifier, typically an ISBN (International Standard Book Number), which serves as the key in the HashMap.

2. **Book Entry**: Librarians or administrators can add new books to the system by entering details such as the book's title, author, publication date, genre, and available copies. These details are stored as values in the HashMap with the ISBN as the key.

3. **Book Issuance**: When a library patron wishes to borrow a book, the system checks the availability of that book using the ISBN. If the book is available, the system updates its availability status and records the borrower's information (e.g., their name and return date). This information is linked to the book's ISBN in the HashMap.

4. **Book Return**: When the borrower returns the book, the system marks the book as available again and removes the borrower's information from the HashMap entry associated with the book.

5. **Displaying the Hashtable**: The system can provide an option to display the current status of the library's book collection, showing which books are available and which ones are checked out. The HashMap allows for efficient retrieval of this information.

6. **Book Management**: Library staff can perform various administrative tasks, such as adding new books, removing books from circulation, updating book information, and tracking overdue books.

Using a HashMap for this Library Management System project offers several advantages, including fast access to book records, efficient management of large book collections, and flexibility in handling various book-related operations. It simplifies book tracking and reduces the time needed to search for information, making the library more user-friendly and efficient.
